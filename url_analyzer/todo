- switch from a full html encoding to just grabbing the relevant parts of the html (especially forms)
- switch to spidering at depth 1 and derive the response chain for every url/form on the starting page (maybe just forms?)
- add IP and domain intelligence to the response
- figure out a better screenshot strategy to cover multi-page screenshots (e.g. screenshot the first page cleanly and then scroll to get other screenshots)

- switch to a SQL data storage scheme
- record a summary of the image of the home page
- move JWT secret key storage to secrets manager


- build an authentication engine with user creation
  - JWT is saved to a file
  - API keys are created from JWT when new users are created
  - Per-API key quota is tracked in a database






xxx- figure out how to capture popups etc to prevent screenshots of the wrong page
