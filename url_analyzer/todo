# Prioritized TODO

- fix docker deployment to lightsail
- develop a cleaner failure mode for urls that don't resolve like test.com
- run tests with a bunch of example phishing pages from urlscan

- switch to a SQL data storage scheme to enable rate limiting

- build an authentication engine with user creation
  - JWT is saved to a file
  - API keys are created from JWT when new users are created
  - Per-API key quota is tracked in a database

- write an API documentation page

# Security Requirements
- switch AWS authentication to IAM
- move JWT secret key storage to secrets manager
- move lightsail DNS to proxy through zero-phishing


# Performance Backlog
- change the classifier to be multiclass (phishing, suspicious, safe) to cover stuff like mail1.pages.dev
- add LLM insights to the display
  - impersonated brands
- try switching to Gemini Flash as a simple free option https://ai.google.dev/pricing
- integrate with webarena schema, especially viewport visible HTML https://github.com/web-arena-x/webarena/blob/1469b7c9d8eaec3177855b3131569751f43a40d6/browser_env/processors.py#L174
- modify the API to enable spidering as well




# Product Backlog
- Hook up a certstream script that logs all recently issues certificates and checks them for phishing




xxx- figure out how to capture popups etc to prevent screenshots of the wrong page
xx- switch from a full html encoding to just grabbing the relevant parts of the html (especially forms)
xx- pipe a description of the image to the LLM classification logic
xx- add IP and domain intelligence to the prompt, http response, and page display
xx- improve user display to show a cleaner organized output
xx- increase speed of the logic to fetch the HTML+Image by refactoring the search logic to just grab the page rather than run a full spider
xx- switch the deployed vercel page to be zerophishing.com
xx- add on http:// to urls that don't have them automatically in React
